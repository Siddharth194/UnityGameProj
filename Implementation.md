# The steps I followed during the course of the completion of this Project:

## 1. The idea:

I have always been fascinated by top-down/Isometric camera angle video games, and games like the Last Day On Earth on mobile was an inspiration behind the game.

## 2. Sprites, Animation and Map:

This was the most time-consuming stage of the project (and should have been done in lesser time than I took for it).

### Main Character sprites:

The character sprite of the Protagonist was downloaded from OpenGameArt (linked in README.md). 

### Animation:

After acquiring images of the body parts, they were put together in GIMP, and animations were created manually using Unity's Skeletal animation, Inverse Kinematics and Sprite Library feature. This was a time consuming process. I used this as opposed to animating in frames using images, as this gives more freedom with range of movements, as one doesn't have to create entire sprites for a single frame of animation.

### Other sprites:

Most weapon sprites were downloaded, but a few were created on GIMP. The Resource box sprite was also created. Buildings and Road images were also downloaded. The game map was created using Unity's tilemap feature. The map is a 100 x 100 grid (for scale, the player is about 1.3 x 1.3)

### Enemy Sprites and Animation:

Enemy sprites were downloaded from OpenGameArt too, but the frames for the death animation had to be created manually. Unlike the player, the enemy has been animated frame by frame using images, due to a limited range of actions associated with the enemy (movement, attacks and death).
